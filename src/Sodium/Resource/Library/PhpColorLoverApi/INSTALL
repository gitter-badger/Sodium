COLOURLovers (http://www.colourlovers.com/) released their API April 2, 2088 for accessing Color(s), Palette(s), Pattern(s) and
Lover(s) information from their site. phpColourLover is a PHP wrapper for this API. This wrapper was designed to implement every
feature available by the COLOURLovers API.

phpColourLover is a PHP5 class which uses SimpleXML and, if available, the cURL library. I am currently working on a simple XML
parser to implement phpColourLover using PHP4, which should be available within a week or to (April 13 or 20). I am also in the
works of developing jsColourLover, a JavaScript wrapper.

To install phpColourLover, extract these files into your diectory of choice and you need to edit the main class file to point
to your desided path.

./phpColourLover.php [Line 19]:
define("PCL_INSTALL_PATH", "/path/to/phpColourLover");

To call phpColourLover in your PHP application, simply add this to your file:
require_once("/path/to/phpColourLover/phpColourLover.php");

For information on the subclasses and methods each one offers, please take a look at ./docs/index.html which will describe each
class method and the way to use it. Also, take a look at ./examples.php for examples on using phpColourLover.
